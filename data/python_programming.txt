Python for Data Science

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has become the de facto language for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

Popular Libraries:
- NumPy: Numerical computing and array operations
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis with DataFrames
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and tools
- TensorFlow: Google's deep learning framework
- PyTorch: Facebook's neural network library
- Matplotlib: Data visualization and plotting

Python's extensive ecosystem, community support, and easy syntax make it ideal for both prototyping and production machine learning systems. It integrates well with other languages and tools.
