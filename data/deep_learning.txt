Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. These networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain to learn from large amounts of data.

Key Components:
- Neural Networks: Interconnected nodes that process information
- Backpropagation: Algorithm for training networks by adjusting weights
- Activation Functions: Non-linear transformations like ReLU and Sigmoid
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Designed for sequential data

Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language understanding. It requires large datasets and significant computational power, often utilizing GPUs for training.
